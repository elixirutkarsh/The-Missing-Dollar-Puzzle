# The-Missing-Dollar-Puzzle

Three friends decide to split the cost of a hotel room equally. The total cost of the room is $30, so each friend contributes $10. The hotel manager realizes that there was a mistake and reduces the price to $25. The manager gives $5 to the bellboy and asks him to return it to the friends. The bellboy, being dishonest, decides to keep $2 for himself and returns $1 to each friend.

Now, let's analyze the situation: Each friend initially paid $10, and each received $1 back. So, they have each effectively paid $9. If you multiply $9 by 3 (the number of friends), you get $27.

The puzzle is: What happened to the missing dollar?

Solution: The missing dollar is actually a red herring in this puzzle. It is a distraction from the real calculation. The friends collectively paid $27 for the room, and the bellboy kept $2, making a total of $29.

However, if you add the $2 kept by the bellboy to the $27 paid by the friends, you get $29, not $30. The discrepancy arises because adding the $2 to the $27 is an incorrect way to calculate the total cost. The correct total cost is $27, and that is accounted for with the $25 paid for the room and the $2 kept by the bellboy.
